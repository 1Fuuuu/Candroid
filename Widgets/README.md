# Widgets for Candroid

Widgets are a new feature for Candroid not in the original draft. I remembered that I forgot to include them on January 17th 2021.

These widgets are more optimized and have some extra benefits, such as:

* Being able to run on many, many more operating systems than the original Android widgets (which only worked well up to version 5.0 or 6.0)

* Being able to run outside of Android

* Not being locked to an API level (preferrably, for a vanilla Android VM, you should set the API level somewhere between 1 and 23)

I have not yet decided what language to write widgets in, but I have to maintain both classic Android and modern/classic Linux compatibility (maybe even Windows, BSD, and/or MacOS compatibility if I get lucky)
